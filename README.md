# Alchemio

A text adventure game about learning (human) languages.

# The elevator pitch

This game is supposed to be about learning languages. It is assumed that your native language (or source language, the one you understand and use as the base for learning) is English, and the target language for now is Finnish (because it's the one I'm learning). In the future, when the concept is fleshed out and polished, I'm planning to add support for at least Japanese as well, maybe more.

The idea is: your source language (English here) describes plain actions: something you would be able to do with your hands or brain in real life, something physically tangible. It's the language for mundane actions. However, your target language (Finnish in this case) is the language of magic which can craft spells and alter reality in supernatural (and hopefully fun) ways. The more "correct" you get the sentence, the stronger the magic spell.

The concept itself is under development for now, and the specifics of the implementation are even more fuzzy, but this is intended as a long-term project that will allow me to practice my functional programming patterns, my F# skills and my Finnish as well, all in a single, hopefully fun and unusual way.

# Project management

For now (until the main concepts and the basic implementation gets fleshed out), I'm planning to be using VS Code's TODO Tree plugin and several types of tasks for the task list, such as TODO, REFACTOR, FIXME, NOTE. So all the "issues" are going to just be specified directly in the code itself.

In the future when the project grows bigger and more stable, I'm planning to switch to GitHub's Issues and Milestones systems instead, plus use CI and automatic unit testing for extra stability. For now though, until we get to the first stable-ish versions, all of these systems just sound like massive overkill. Just using the TODOs will allow me to focus on quick iteration instead of docs and maintenance as well.
